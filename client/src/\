SKILLS
<p/>
Agile: I did web development using agile practices at my summer internship at Hewlett Packard.
<br/>
AVR Assembler Code: I have worked in a bare metal environment using AVR Assembler Code a couple of times during my schooling. This included the development of a simple operating system.
<br/>
AWS: I touched on AWS in my own personal time.
<br/>
Bash: I did the majority of my classwork by SSH'ing onto campus Linux machines. Thus, the majority of the time, I worked with Bash.
<br/>
Bootstrap: I used Bootstrap in my full stack development and open source courses that I took at PSU recently. I also used Bootstrap in this website. 
<br/>
C/C++: Over the last several years, most of my programming at school has been in C++ and it is my strongest language.
<br/>
CSS: I used CSS in tandem with HTML on this website and also in my full stack development and open source courses that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
Databases: At my summer internship at Hewlett Packard, I collected large quantities of data from a database at a high throughput in order to display statistics for the run time of large scale printers. I’ve also taken several courses dealing with the creation of and communication with databases utilizing MySQL.
<br/>
Git/GitHub: I’ve used GitHub to manage various school projects and personal projects. https://github.com/AlexEdbrookeDavis .
<br/>
Haskell: I have worked with Haskell a couple of times in my schooling and found it to be very intuitive.
<br/>
HTML: I used HTML on this website and also in my full stack development and open source courses that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
IDEs (Visual studios, CodeBlocks, IntelliJ): I’ve used a number of integrated development environments including Visual Studios, CodeBlocks, and IntelliJ.
<br/>
Java: I have been learning Java over the last year. I like it because it is a more intuitive language.
<br/>
JavaScript: I used JavaScript at my summer internship at Hewlett Packard where I was doing web development using agile practices. I did a fairly large JavaScript project for my Open Source Software Development Lab course last summer. I used JavaScript in my full stack development course that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
JQuery: I used JQuery in my full stack development course that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
Linux: I did the majority of my classwork by SSH'ing onto campus Linux machines, and I have since set up a Linux machine at home.
<br/>
Node.js: I used Node.js in my full stack development course that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
OpenGL: I have extensive knowledge and experience with OpenGL programming because of my personal interest in the topic:
<br/>
•	I’ve taken several courses involving OpenGL, including 3D Computer Graphics and Computer Graphics Shaders.  
<br/>
•	My year-long Senior Software Engineering Project – 3-D Vector Visualization –  used OpenGL.
<br/>
•	I’ve had a lot of out of school practice setting up and running OpenGL libraries, including GLEW, GLUT, GLFW, GLM, and GLSL. I have recently started an OpenGL project creating the beginnings of a game engine: https://github.com/AlexEdbrookeDavis/ColorGame .
<br/>
PHP: I used PHP in my full stack development course that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
Python: I have worked with Python periodically in my schooling.
<br/>
PyTorch: I used PyTorch in my Visual Computing course.
<br/>
React: I just started using React for this website. I find it to be intuitive, allowing for more flexibility and speed when writing a front-end page.
<br/>
REST: I used REST in my full stack development course that I took at PSU recently.
<br/>
RS232: I worked with Wavelength References to create an interface for testing laser-based equipment utilizing RS232 communications.
<br/>
Ruby on Rails: I used Ruby on Rails at my summer internship at Hewlett Packard. 
<br/>
SQL: I worked with SQL in my internship at Hewlett Packard to manage highly parallel communications with a remote database. I’ve also taken several courses dealing with the creation of and communication with databases utilizing MySQL.
<br/>
TCP/IP networking: I’ve worked with TCP/IP networking in classes at school.
<br/>
VirtualBox: I used VirtualBox to design and run low level operating systems for one of my classes.

COMMUNICATIONS/TEAMWORK/LEARNING/INTERESTS
<p/>
•	My many years at school have honed my verbal and written communication skills including experience with word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation creation tools (power point).
<br/>
•	I demonstrated leadership, organizational, and communication skills during my Eagle Scout Project for Boy Scouts.
<br/>
•	I’ve done numerous group projects at school and work well at coordinating and collaborating with others. I tend to bring a different perspective to team problem solving.
<br/>
•	I have an analytical mindset that helps in project planning and scheduling, catching technical issues that may be missed by others, and drives me towards creating quality code.
<br/>
•	I’m a fast learner and can quickly catch up on anything I don’t have experience in.
<br/>
•	I’m particularly interested in algorithm optimization, machine learning, graphics, and mathematics.
